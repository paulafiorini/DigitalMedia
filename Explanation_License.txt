Why did I choose the MIT license?

I have chosen MIT license as the open-source license for my project because the three.js’ authors 
used that license and it imposes the condition that the copyright and the permission notice shall 
be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software, and I used their code in my project. 
Like the authors of three.js I do not care that the code is used, copied, modified, merged, published,or 
distributed even in proprietary programs. Moreover, it was my first contact with WebGL, for this reason 
I do not offer any guarantee of my code and that license also contains a clause about the absence of guarantee.
